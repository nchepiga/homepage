**Openings**
============

PhD and postdoc positions are currently available in my newly established group on Quantum Many-Body Physics at TUDelft.
The group will focus on a development of tensor network algorithms and applications to:

- Quantum magnetism;   
- Rydberg atoms and systems with unconventional Hilbert space in and out of equilibrium;   
- Exotic quantum phase transitions;   
- Quantum scars and related topics;   
- Supersymmetry.   
If you are interested in joining the group contact me by e-mail. 
Soft deadline is January 31 2021, but later applications will be considered until all positions are filled.
