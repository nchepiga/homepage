**Openings**
============

PhD and postdoc positions are currently available in my newly established group on Computational Quantum Many-Body Physics at TUDelft.
The group will focus on a **development of tensor network algorithms and applications** to:

- Exotic quantum phase transitions;   
- Quantum magnetism;   
- Rydberg atoms and systems with unconventional Hilbert space in and out of equilibrium;   
- Quantum scars and constrained dynamics;   
- Supersymmetry.   

I am primary looking for candidates with strong numerical background, but excellent candidates with expertise in other areas of condensed matter theory will also be considered. Applications should be sent by e-mail and contain an academic CV including list of publications, the (provisional) title of the PhD/Master thesis, a motivation letter, and the contact information of two referees.
Applications will be considered until all positions are filled.
