Delft Many-Body Workshop Series
===============================


Understanding collective phenomena in strongly correlated quantum many-body systems is one of the biggest challenges in modern condensed matter physics. Development of efficient computational methods and conformal field theory topped up with the recent progress on cold atoms experiments make the study of low-dimensional strongly correlated systems one of the hottest topics in the field. The goal of this workshop is to bring together local experts working on various aspects of quantum many-body theory to regenerate the network of scientific connections and to initiate new collaborations in the area.
